## Anonymising Data

The purpose of [anonymising](http://kau.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1043735/FULLTEXT01.pdf) data is to make it impossible to:
1. Single out an individual in the dataset. 
1. Link records concerning the same individual.
1. Infer the value of one attribute based on other values.

There are 2 ways to ensure anonymity of data:
1. [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity). This is implemented by:
    1. Suppression. For instance, all or some values of a particular column may be omitted through replacing it with a "\*".
    1. Generalisation. For instance, the medical condition can be replaced by a more general term (e.g., “Cardiovascular disease” replaced by “Heart-related”).
    
    An example of pre-anonymised data:
    
    ![pre-anonymised data](/images/pre_anonymisation.png)
    
    After applying 2-anonymity to the data. Notice that this data has 2-anonymity with respect to the attributes "Age" and "Gender", but not for the attribute "Disease":

1. [Adding noise to the data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-017-0110-7). This is implemented by swapping cells within columns and replacing groups of k records with k copies of a single representative.

There's an existing well-established [library](https://arx.deidentifier.org/overview/) available to perform k-anonymity, complete with [examples](https://github.com/arx-deidentifier/arx/tree/master/src/example/org/deidentifier/arx/examples).
