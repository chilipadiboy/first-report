### Design Report - Week 3

##### Project Meeting with Prof
- Clarify any questions with regards to the subsystems implementation or Design Report requirements

##### Write Design Report
- Propose specifications and designs for each subsystem with regards to implementation, interfaces, controls and protocols
- Finish up Design Report


### Prototype Demo - Week 4 to 7

##### Setup Subsytems
- Setup Ansible configuration management tool
- Setup web service using Spring Boot and GraphQL
- Setup Multi-factor Authentication Tag BLE communication capability
- Setup database and create tables
- Setup and configuration of servers to make sure required services are up and running
- Basic user interface and design

##### Integrated Product
- Integration of all subsystems i.e. Tag + Front-end + Back-end connected together, allowing information flow between systems
- Basic functionalities of each individual subsystem may not be fully achieved yet

##### Minimum Viable Product
- Implementation of all basic features proposed in Design report

##### Testing and Refinement
- Improve on product functionality for a fully integrate and fully functional Healthcare records system
- Some subsystems may not be fully secure yet


### Final Report and Demo - Week 8 to 11

##### Implementation of security features
- Hardening of subsystems
- Looking out for possible and known vulnerablities and shutting them down

##### Additional features
- Implement any additional features that we find along the way that we feel will be able to improve on the functionality and security of our subsystem

##### Write Final Report
- Finish up Final Report
